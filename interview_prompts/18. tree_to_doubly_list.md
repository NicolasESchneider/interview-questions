## Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List 

### Usage

1. Give just the **Prompt** to the student
2. Use the **Interviewer Notes** to guide the session if they get stuck
3. Give the **Possible Solution** to the student at the end of the session

### Prompt

```javascript
// Convert a BST to a sorted circular doubly-linked list in-place. Think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the previous and next pointers in a doubly-linked list.

// We want to transform this BST into a circular doubly linked list. Each node in a doubly linked list has a predecessor and successor. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.


// Specifically, we want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. We should return the pointer to the first element of the linked list.

### Interview Notes

Leading questions to pose to the student:

### Possible Solutions

```javascript
// recursive solution
var treeToDoublyList = function(root) {
    let last = null;
    let first = null;
    if (!root) return null;
    function helper (node) {
        if (node) {
            helper(node.left);
            if (last) {
                last.right = node;
                node.left = last;
            } else {
                first = node;
            }
            last = node;
            helper(node.right)
        }
    
    }
    helper(root);
    first.left = last;
    last.right = first;
    return first;
};
