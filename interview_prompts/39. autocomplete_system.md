## Design Autocomplete System

### Usage

1. Give just the **Prompt** to the interviewee
2. Use the **Interviewer Notes** to guide the session if they get stuck
3. Give the **Possible Solution** to the interviewee at the end of the session

### Prompt

```javascript

// Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:

// The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
// The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
// If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
// When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.

// Your job is to implement the following functions:

// The constructor function:

// AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): This is the constructor. The input is historical data. Sentences is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. Times is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.

// Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:

// List<String> input(char c): The input c is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), blank space (' ') or a special character ('#'). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.

 
// Example:
// Operation: AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island","ironman", "i love leetcode"], [5,3,2,2])
// The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:
// "i love you" : 5 times
// "island" : 3 times
// "ironman" : 2 times
// "i love leetcode" : 2 times
// Now, the user begins another search:

// Operation: input('i')
// Output: ["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"]
// Explanation:
// There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and "i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored.

// Operation: input(' ')
// Output: ["i love you","i love leetcode"]
// Explanation:
// There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ".

// Operation: input('a')
// Output: []
// Explanation:
// There are no sentences that have prefix "i a".

// Operation: input('#')
// Output: []
// Explanation:
// The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.

 
// Note:

// The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only one blank space will exist between two words.
// The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.
// Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases even for a character input.
// Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.

### Interview Notes

Leading questions to pose to the interviewee:
- Use Trie for fastest runtime
