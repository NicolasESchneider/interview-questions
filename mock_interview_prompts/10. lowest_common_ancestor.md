## Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

### Usage

1. Give just the **Prompt** to the student
2. Use the **Interviewer Notes** to guide the session if they get stuck
3. Give the **Possible Solution** to the student at the end of the session

### Prompt

```javascript
// Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

// Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

//        3
//      /   \
//    5      1
//   / \    / \
//  6   2  0   8
//     / \
//    7   4

// Example 1:

// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

// Example 2:
// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

// Note:
// All of the nodes' values will be unique.
// p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

// Assume the following node class:
//
// class TreeNode {
//     constructor(val) {
//         this.val = val;
//         this.left = this.right = null;
//     }
// }

// Similar problem from Leet Code #236 (https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/)

### Possible Solutions

```javascript
// Iterative Solution

// Time Complexity:
//      O(n) where n is the number of the nodes in the binary tree
// Space Complexity:
//      O(1)
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
  if (!root || root === p || root === q) return root;

  var resL = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
  var resR = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

  if (resL && resR) {
    // if resL and resR are not null, that means p and q are on different branches
    // which means p is not q's ancestor, and q is not p's ancestor either.
    // We can return their lowest root
    return root;
  } else {
    // if either resL or resR is null, that means p and q are on the same branch,
    // because we return one of the target nodes before we found another one, and we can't find another node on the other branch
    // So, that means p is q's ancestor, or q is p's ancestor
    // We can return resL or resR, whichever is the ancestor (not null)
    return resL || resR;
  }

};
```
