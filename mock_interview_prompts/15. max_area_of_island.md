## Max Area of Island

### Usage

1. Give just the **Prompt** to the student
2. Use the **Interviewer Notes** to guide the session if they get stuck
3. Give the **Possible Solution** to the student at the end of the session

### Prompt

```javascript
// Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

// Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

// Example 1:
// [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
//  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
//  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
//  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
//  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
//  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
//  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
//  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
// Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

// Example 2:
// [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
// Given the above grid, return 0.

### Possible Solutions

```javascript
// Recursive Solution

var maxAreaOfIsland = function(grid) {
  let max = 0;
  for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
      if (grid[row][col] === 1) {
        let area = [0];
        search(grid, row, col, area);
        max = Math.max(max, area[0]);
      }
    }
  }
  return max;
};

function search(grid, row, col, area) {
  if (row < 0 || row >= grid.length || col < 0 || col >= grid[0].length) return;
  if (grid[row][col] === 0 || grid[row][col] === "*") return;
  area[0]++;
  grid[row][col] = "*";

  search(grid, row - 1, col, area);
  search(grid, row + 1, col, area);
  search(grid, row, col - 1, area);
  search(grid, row, col + 1, area);
}
